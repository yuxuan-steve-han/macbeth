## About The Project

I created this website for my assignment: 3 songs relating to a specific theme in Macbeth. I chose to make a fully responsive, interactable demo to test my skills in React.

What it consists of:
* Responsive CSS, for all screen sizes, made from scratch
* Custom audio players, capable of auto skipping and auto pausing
* An analysis of Macbeth's themes relating to the songs.

### Built With

* React
* Chakra UI
* Typescript
